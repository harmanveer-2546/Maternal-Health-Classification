Women experience an unfathomable thrill when they
bring revival into the world. Several mother deserve to
experience that happiness. However, this situation either
becomes frightening for many women in this environment.
Pregnancy-related infections, excessive bleeding, and high
blood pressure account for two-thirds of all maternal
deaths. Complications from pregnancy are one of the major
cause of death in girls between the ages in teen. Teenage
girls are actually more vulnerable to pregnancy risks since
their bodies are still developing. Child brides are more
likely to experience pregnancy-related complications
because they are less likely to obtain adequate medical care
while pregnant or give birth in a medical facility. Maternal mortality is still a major issuein many countries,
especially developing ones, despite advances in medical
research.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports
that every day, almost 810 pregnant women and 6,700
babies pass away. Several non-communicable diseases may
arise because of epigenetic modifications linked to
maternal diet and chemical exposures. Early life
environmental pressures, which are referred to as the new
discovery origins of health and disease, are assumed to be
caused by these epigenetic modifications. influences the
risk of chronic illness. The shortage of doctors and
nurses, as well as localization, timing, and distance, are a
few of the factors that raise the mortality rate of pregnant
women and childbirth (Redondi et al., 2013). According to
an estimate by the WHO, 800 women will die every day in
2020 as a result of inadequate resources and treatment
(Castillejo et al., 2013). It is challenging to assure both the
mother and the unborn child's safety during pregnancy
because, despite recenttechnical advancements, the rate of
maternal deaths is declining. In this situation, pregnancy- related risks can be
decreased by foreseeing difficulties and taking preemptive
measures. where it is observed to be greater . It has been
discovered that the increased frequency of maternal anemia
in LMICs is associated with a number of poor
consequences for pregnant women and their babies. For
instance, it is estimated that 20% of all maternal deaths
globally are caused by anemia during pregnancy .
Additionally, it is predicted that anemia contributes to
591,000 perinatal fatalities globally, with South Asia
and Africa accounting for the majority of these deaths.

### Data Set Information:

Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

* Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.
* SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
* DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
* BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
* HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
* Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attribute.
